# uw_manipulation

Tools for detecting grasp poses and manipulating objects.

The current grasp client was [originally developed](https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_gazebo/blob/gazebo9/fetch_gazebo_demo) by Fetch as a demo. Requires installation and launch of [simple_grasping](https://github.com/mikeferguson/simple_grasping). Make sure to get rosdep dependencies before trying to run it.
