# astro_description

A fork of `fetch_description` that includes our customizations. Based on an xacro-fied version of the original called `fetch_simple_description` that seems to be [floating around](https://github.com/Rowing0914/OpenAI_ROS_dev/tree/1a0ac6f03bb7de53c8696d261b811fda849945dc/fetch_simple_simulation).
